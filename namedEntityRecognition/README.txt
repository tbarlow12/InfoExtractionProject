- How to compile and run my code
  python ner.py <train_file> <test_file> <fType>
- Or, if your filenames are 'train.txt' and 'test.txt',
  you can simply enter the command below to test all modes:
  sh ner.sh
- I tested this on the lab1-11 machine in the CADE lab
- No known bugs or limitations in my program
