Here are the accuracy results that you should get for each 
ftype argument: 

word:    88.3149%
wordcap: 87.6986%
poscon:  87.9428%
lexcon:  89.0241%
bothcon: 88.8458%

NOTE: the classifier may take some time to train, especially as more
features are given to it. We estimate that it may take roughly 1
minute to train for lexcon, and 2 minutes to train for bothcon, but
your mileage may vary depending on your computing platform.
